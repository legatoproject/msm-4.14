* SWIMCU kl03 microcontroller IC

Required parent device properties:
- compatible : "swimcu,mkl03"
- reg : the I2C slave address for the swimcu kl03 chip
- swimcu,nr-gpio : indicates the gpio number of swimcu
- swimcu,adc-base : assigns the adc base index for swimcu adc
- swimc,nr-adc : indicates the adc channel number of swimcu
* Refer to the arch/arm/mach-msm/swimcu.h to set the value

Optional parent device properties:
- swimcu,func-fwupd-en : /bits/ 8 enables firmware node in the swimcu-pm module of sys
- swimcu,func-pm-en : /bits/ 8 enable boot_source node in the swimcu-pm module of sys
- swimcu,func-event-en : /bits/ 8 enables event parse in the swimcu-pm module of sys

Examples:

&i2c_4 {
	swimcu@3a{
		compatible = "swimcu,mkl03";
		reg = <0x3a>;
		swimcu,nr-gpio = <8>;
		swimcu,nr-adc = <2>;
		swimcu,adc-base = <2>;

		swimcu,func-fwupd-en = /bits/ 8 <1>;
		swimcu,func-pm-en = /bits/ 8 <1>;
		swimcu,func-event-en = /bits/ 8 <1>;
	};
};
